# Solution

- Start connecting to each replica set and test status. You will see that 30000 is the Primary and other two are Secondaries nodes.

- After that check mongostat to see what is happening (I am using with --discover option):

```
mongostat --discover --port 30000
```

From mongostat we can deduce that there is an incredible amount of new connections what is causing memory consumption increase.

- Second we can connect to each replica set member and check available connections vs used connections.

```
db.serverStatus().connections
{ "current" : 165, "available" : 654, "totalCreated" : 345 }
```

As we can see we still have available connections but we are using more and more connections.
