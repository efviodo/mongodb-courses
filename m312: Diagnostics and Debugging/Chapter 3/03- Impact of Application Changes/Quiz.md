**Answer**
The following are correct. Keeping historical monitoring data allows you to ...

* predict the normal behavior of your application.
  * With historical data, you should be able to predict what your application's behavior will look like, to the database, for normal behavior.

* compare your current application performance with benchmarked data.
  * With historical data, you can compare current performance with historical benchmarks, a useful way of determining if your behavior is normal or not.

This is incorrect:

-   Keeping historical monitoring data allows you to correct future problems, like a crystal ball.
    -   As it has been said, ["It's difficult to make predictions, especially about the future."](http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/10/20/no-predict/)
