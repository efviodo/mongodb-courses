________________________

Correct answer:

    The one correct answer is mtools, which includes the log parsing tool, mlogfilter, and the visualization tools, mlogvis and mplotqueries, as well as mloginfo, the log parsing tool.

Incorrect answers:

    Mongostat is good for determining current activity on a server, but not for dealing with log files.
    Mongotop is good for determining how current activity is distributed across collections/databases, but not with dealing with log files.
    Mongoreplay is good for recreating a query load at a later time and another location, but not for dealing with log files.
    Mongooplog is for locally applying oplog entries polled from a remote server. It does not deal with the server logs, just the oplog (or operations log).
