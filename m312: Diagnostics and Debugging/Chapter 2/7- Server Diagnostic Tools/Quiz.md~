Only mongostat has this functionality. mongoreplay can capture the queries, but doesn't let me know how many are coming in each second in real-time. mongotop looks at time spent in each namespace, but doesn't count queries. mongoperf only looks at simulating a disk I/O load, not at monitoring performance at all.
