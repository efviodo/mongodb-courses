# Lab: Analyze Log Components

From configuration file we extrtac the location of mongo logs file:

```
cat single.cfg 

systemLog:
  destination: file
  path: /home/vagrant/single.log
processManagement:
  fork: true
net:
  port: 27000
  maxIncomingConnections: 10
storage:
  dbPath: /home/vagrant/data

```

Then we analyse the logfile and read what is happening:

```
cat /home/vagrant/single.log
```
